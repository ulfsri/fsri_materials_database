HF25-Frame_R4,8836.00,Dimensions: 10088 x 100.67 x 3.11 mm; with frame; 60 mm spacing,"Sample formed a bubble prior to ignition. Ignition occurred when the bubble contacted the spark ignitor, therefore time to ignition data should be ignored. Also possible for spike in mass data prior to ignition."
HF25_R1,9949.03,Dimensions: 99.93 x 99.56 x 3.12 mm; 60 mm spacing,Sample did not ignite. Expanded vertically. See post test pictures. 
HF25_R2,9940.07,Dimensions: 99.55 x 99.85 x 3.08 mm; 60 mm spacing,"Prior to ignition, the sample expanded vertically and a single large bubble formed. A small hole opened in the bubble which produced a candle-sized flame. The time to ignition event was recorded when the flame began spreading across the surface of the sample. "
HF25_R3,9985.01,Dimensions: 99.95 x 99.90 x 3.10 mm; 60 mm spacing,"Prior to ignition, the sample expanded vertically and a single large bubble formed. Top of the bubble touched the spark ignitor which immediately created a small hole releasing a candle-sized flame. This flame remained steady for approximately one minute with occassonal bursts as gases released from the bubble. The time to ignition event was recorded when the flame began spreading across the surface of the sample. "
HF50_R1,9935.09,Dimensions: 99.55 x 99.80 x 3.00 mm; 60 mm spacing ,Minor spilled out of foil pan into lower drip tray.
HF50_R2,9976.01,Dimensions: 99.89 x 99.87 x 2.99 mm; 60 mm spacing,Minor spill out of foil pan into lower drip tray.
HF50_R3,9916.17,Dimensions: 99.52 x 99.64 x 3.00 mm; 60 mm spacing, 
HF75_R1,9972.02,Dimensions: 99.88 x 99.84 x 3.06 mm,Sample warped prior to ignition and contacted the spark ignitor. Caused spike in mass data and likely shortened time to ignition. Minor spilling of sample out of foil pan after ignition. See test pictures.
HF75_R2,9941.06,Dimensions: 99.53 x 99.88 x 3.11 mm; 60 mm spacing, 
HF75_R3,9974.01,Dimensions: 99.81 x 99.93 x 3.11 mm; 60 mm spacing,Minor spilling of sample out of foil pan after ignition. See post test pictures.
