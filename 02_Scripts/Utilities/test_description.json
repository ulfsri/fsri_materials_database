Dripping was limited in some tests by manually adjusting the foil pan during the test, which caused spikes in the mass time history data. At the 25 kW/m<sup>2</sup> exposure, warping of the sample prior to ignition sometimes impacted the spark ignitor. This caused a spike in the mass time history data and likely affected the time to ignition. Other tests were conducted at the 60 mm spacing from the cone heater to prevent this: HF25_R5, HF25_R6, HF50_R2, HF50_R4.
