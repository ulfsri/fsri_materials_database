        "Cone": "<global_intro>This material initially warps and shrivels under thermal exposure, then melts after ignition into a pool fire that is uniformly distributed across the foil pan. A common result of this behavior was melted sample dripping from the foil pan during some tests. Dripping was limited in some tests by manually adjusting the foil pan during the test, which caused spikes in the mass time history data. At the 25 kW/m<sup>2</sup> exposure, warping of the sample prior to ignition sometimes impacted the spark ignitor. This caused a spike in the mass time history data and likely affected the time to ignition. Other tests were conducted at the 60 mm spacing from the cone heater to prevent this: HF25_R5, HF25_R6, HF50_R2, HF50_R4.
